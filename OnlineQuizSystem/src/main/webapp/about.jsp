						<p>Online Quiz System is a web-based quiz system for accessing
							students. It is a system by which students can sit in a quiz
							which need no pencil and paper. Nowadays, students take quiz
							manually. Lecturers need spend more time on grading. Other than
							that, the quiz paper maybe will be missing. Students need to wait
							for lecturers finish grading to get their result. Therefore, this
							system will help lecturers save their time because of automated
							marking</p>
